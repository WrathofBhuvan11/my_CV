Blurb (if needed)

Shreesh has a comprehensive understanding of the computer stack which allows him to balance between high-level thinking and rigorous bottom-up analysis grounded in strong fundamentals.


His engineering expertise extends beyond the classroom - he actively contributed to the development of the Memory Processing Unit architecture and its verification flow at the Data Storage Systems Center in Pittsburgh. His proficiency with commonly used ASIC development tools (C++, SystemVerilog, Python), combined with strong fundamentals in VLSI, Microarchitecture, and Verification, would prove him a valuable addition to the team.


He understands the interdependence of business and engineering, and what goes into building a successful product. The holistic understanding makes him a potential long-term asset.


Besides his field knowledge, he is open to new ideas and a clear communicator, making him a seamless collaborator in cross-functional teams.
